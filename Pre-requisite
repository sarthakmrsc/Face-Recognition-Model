1. Make a file for the pictures to be used as the dataset and then put the pictures inside that dataset.
2. Make an excel file for .xlsx file part and name it as "metadata" [I have named it metadata for my own understanding you can name it whatever suits you]
3. Make sure to change the threshold values to get better results. [I have set it to 0.25 since my dataset is less]
4. Use atleast 1000 picture dataset to get good results.
